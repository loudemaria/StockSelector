# StockSelector
 Web crawler and spreadsheet generator for US listed securities

Developed and last tested with the follosing packages:
 Python 3.10.4 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/
 BeautifulSoup 4.11.1 https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
 yFinance 0.1.70 https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/
 
Developed in a Windows 10 environment using Visual Studio Code.

AnalyzeSecuritiesMultithreaded.py is a file that will crawl every listed ticker on US stock enchanges (Assuming that your listed securitite files are up to date.  More on that to follow) and generate a spreadsheet with data associates with each ticker that is relevant to that ticker.  Please not that yFinance does not always seem to be 100% accurate.  Check the numbers on the yahoo finance website, or another data provider before making a final decision.  I'll say it's mostly accurate, but found discrepencies.  Line 216 (as of this commit.  "or thereabouts" going forward) contains a value.  5 in this case.  A 'for' loop generates threads to go do your web crawling and data generation for you.  Waiting for server responses takes most of this program's time.  This number can be modified to fit your needs.  More is not always faster however.

CalculateIntrinsicValue.py is a file that will calculate the intrinsic value of a given security using Benjamin Graham's Intrinsic Value Formula.  ((EPS_TTM)*(8.5+(2*GROWTH_ESTIMATES_NEXT_10_YEARS))*(4.4))/((aaa_corporate_bond_yield)).  Out of an abundance of caution, I assume onl;y 1/2 of what the growth estimates over the next 10 years is, essentially, in the code, instead of (2*GROWTH_ESTIMATES_NEXT_10_YEARS), I just use (GROWTH_ESTIMATES_NEXT_10_YEARS), removing the 2 multiplier.  Furthermore, I have yet to find a site that will bive me growth estimates over the next 10 years.  The best I can find is growth estimates over the next 5 years which is used in the calculation.  This is the same calculation that is used in the intrinsic value calculation column of the spreadsheet generated by AnalyzeSecuritiesMultithreaded.py.

CheckMyPositions.py is a probram that spits out a spreadsheet with stock information of only securities that you care about as defined in mystocks.txt.

nasdaqlisted.txt - Must be manually maintained in order to remain fully accurate.  COpy and paste this file that is updated: http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqlisted.txt

otherlisted.txt - Must be manually maintained in order to remain fully accurate.  COpy and paste this file that is updated: http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/otherlisted.txt

mystocks.txt - List of stocks in my portfolio, price paid and number of shares held.  This will chance and be different for you.  Used in CheckMyPositions.py

Files generated are .csv files.  Use your favorite .csv interaction program to open them.  Mine is Excel.  I'll often open and save as an actual .xlsx afterwards.
